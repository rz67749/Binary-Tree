Ricardo wrote a skeleton of the files. He worked on the printing functions and 
the insert function. Anthony wrote the remaining functions and debugged the program,
fixed memory leak problems, and polished off the project. We both worked on the main
file as we went in order to test our functions.

To Compile: make
To Run: ./main input.txt
